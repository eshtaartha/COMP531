1. I liked the presentation "Hybrid Mobile Apps" the most. The presntation was laid out in a concise manner and
was delivered in a crisp way. I could clearly understand the content that was delivered.

2. I learnt about Reflect. I learnt how to add data visualization to websites using react and how it helps in
e-marketing.

3. I liked the talk on "Progressive Web Apps" the most beacuse I think the presentation was neat, the delivery was fluid
and understandable and the content was good.
