1. I think I have learnt more than what I initially had in mind. Thanks a lot for that!

2. Learning REDUX and REACT was cool. I like the idea of having different states and how react manages various views to deliver
   a seamless user experience.

3. I think the best part of the course was that we were taught state of the art technologies. I'm not from a computer
   engineering background. I am from an electrical background. Whenever I talk to my CS friends about the concepts I have 
   learnt they always appreciate the concepts. I'm very happy about that.

4. I think it would have been better if projects were spaced based on their difficulty level. 
   Some of the inclass exercises were difficult and required a lot of time. It would have been better if a 
   little more help/hints were offered through slides. Sometimes we used to have other classes after web dev class and
   we had to do the inclass exercises at home. Some of the inclass exercises were very hard to solve individually sitting at home.
   QA on piazza helped but generally people take sometime to respond to doubts and we wont get a lot of time for inclass exercises.
   So, more hints on slides for difficult exercises would definitely help.

5. I don't have any other concerns in my mind.

THANK YOU! :-)
