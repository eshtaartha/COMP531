1. I liked the presentation "Vue.js" the most. The presntation was 
was delivered clearly. I could easily understand the content that was delivered.

2. I learnt about GraphQL. I learnt how GraphQL is different from Express which we was used for course work. I learnt that
GraphQL can be simpler to use compared to Express in certain situations.

3. I liked the talk on "WebRTC" the most beacuse I think the presentation was neat, the delivery was fluid
and understandable and the content was good.
